   ```bash
   node --version
   # Should be v18.x, v20.x, or v22.x
   # If not, install compatible version:
   # curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
   # nvm install 20 && nvm use 20
   ```

2. **Verify Project Location**:
   ```bash
   ls /Users/leandroalmeida/iOS_DICOM/iOS_DICOMViewer.xcodeproj
   # Should exist - this is your iOS project
   ```

   ```bash
   npm install
   # This installs all required MCP server packages
   ```

2. **Build Custom Servers**:
   ```bash
   # Build DICOM-specific server
   cd custom-dicom-mcp && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
   
   # Build Swift/iOS tools server  
   cd swift-tools-mcp && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
   
   # Build GitHub Copilot enhancement server
   cd github-copilot-medical-ios && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Authentication (2 minutes)

1. **Create GitHub Token**:
   - Go to [GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer Settings ‚Üí Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - Generate new token with scopes: `repo`, `read:org`, `read:user`
   - Copy the token

2. **Set Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Add to your shell profile (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
   echo 'export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   
   # Verify it's set
   echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | cut -c1-10  # Shows first 10 characters
   ```

### Step 4: Verify Installation (2 minutes)

1. **Run Quick Test**:
   ```bash
   node comprehensive-mcp-test-suite.js
   # Should show mostly green ‚úÖ results
   ```

2. **Check Key Components**:
   ```bash
   ls -la custom-dicom-mcp/dist/index.js      # ‚úÖ Should exist
   ls -la swift-tools-mcp/dist/index.js       # ‚úÖ Should exist  
   ls -la github-copilot-medical-ios/dist/index.js  # ‚úÖ Should exist
   ```

### Step 5: Configure Claude Code (1 minute)

1. **Set Up Claude Code Configuration**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/claude-code
   cp master-mcp-config.json ~/.config/claude-code/config.json
   ```

2. **Restart Claude Code**:
   - Close Claude Code completely
   - Reopen it
   - Verify MCP servers are available
