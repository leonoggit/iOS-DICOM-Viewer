# Swift Tools MCP Server - Quick Start Guide

## Prerequisites

Before using the Swift Tools MCP Server, ensure you have:

- macOS (required for Xcode tools)
- Xcode installed (latest version recommended)
- Node.js 16+ installed
- An iOS project to analyze

## Installation

1. **Navigate to the MCP server directory:**
   ```bash
   cd swift-tools-mcp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the server:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # Should start the MCP server (use Ctrl+C to stop)
   ```

## Quick Usage Examples

### 1. Analyze Your iOS Project

```bash
# Example with the iOS DICOM Viewer project
# Replace with your actual project path
PROJECT_PATH="/path/to/iOS_DICOMViewer.xcodeproj"
```

Analyze project structure:
- Targets and schemes
- Build configurations
- Dependencies (CocoaPods, SPM)
- Project health issues

### 2. Check Swift Code Quality

Analyze Swift files for:
- Syntax errors
- Style guideline violations
- Performance issues
- Memory management problems
- iOS best practices

### 3. Validate iOS Deployment

Check deployment readiness:
- Info.plist validation
- Bundle identifier checks
- Version information
- Privacy permissions
- Capabilities configuration

### 4. Compile and Analyze Metal Shaders

For medical imaging or graphics applications:
- Compile Metal shaders
- Performance analysis
- Device compatibility checks
- Optimization suggestions

### 5. Memory Profiling

Detect potential issues:
- Memory leaks
- Retain cycles
- Excessive allocations
- DICOM-specific memory patterns

### 6. Simulator Management

Manage iOS simulators:
- List available simulators
- Boot/shutdown simulators
- Install and launch apps
- View simulator logs
